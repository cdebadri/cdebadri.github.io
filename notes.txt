Story

Saga so far -
The Mlecchians have conquered the galaxy and have put the revolting planets under stringent embargo, preventing any weapons or aids from
reaching them. While the revolutionary forces are launching small scale guerilla attacks to avenge the plight of the galaxy, they're met with
a heavy hand from the superior Mlecchian forces. There's a communication station in deep space which relays information on revolutionary
troop movement. We need you, off-worlder, to destroy that station and give the revolutionaries a chance!
